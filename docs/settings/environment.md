To manage environment variables, open the `.env` file located in the root directory of your project. You can edit this file to configure various settings such as database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific configurations. Use a text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or any code editor to modify the `.env` file.

Example command to open `.env` with `nano`:

```bash
nano .env
```

Make the necessary changes and save the file to apply the new configurations.
