## ID Card Generation

The Student Management System provides a convenient way to generate student ID cards. Currently, the ID card design is static, but a template designer is coming soon.

### Generating ID Cards

To generate ID cards, navigate to **Student Management → ID Cards → Generate**. Select the students you want to generate ID cards for. You can select individual students or generate ID cards for an entire class or section.

### Printing and Saving

Once the ID cards are generated, you can print them directly from the browser or save them as PDF files. The generated ID cards can be saved to a file or printed directly from the browser.
