### Assigning Teachers in Class

Teachers can be assigned to classes and sections in the Class Management section. To assign a teacher to a class, navigate to **Teacher Management > Teacher** and click **Assign Class**.

Once a teacher is assigned to a class, they will only be able to manage the students and subjects within that class. This helps to ensure that teachers only have access to the information they need to perform their duties.

When a teacher is assigned to a class, they will be able to:

- View student information and attendance
- Mark attendance for students
- Enter grades for students
- View assignments and submit grades
- View the class timetable

Teachers can also be assigned to multiple classes, allowing them to manage multiple classes and sections.
